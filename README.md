# linked-list
Simple assembly linked-list implementation with functions running on RARS 1.1
(RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator)


<h3> How does this program work? </h3>

  1. Reads integers from console input until a negative integer is given.
  2. For every integer, it creates a linked list node and saves it in its 'data' field.
  3. Reads an integer, and prints all the elements in the list that are smaller than the given integer.
     If the integer we read is negative, the program ends.
  4. Loops back to step 3.
